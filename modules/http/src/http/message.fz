HTTP does not place a predefined limit on the length of a request-line, as described in Section 2.3 of [HTTP]. A server that receives a method longer than any that it implements SHOULD respond with a 501 (Not Implemented) status code. A server that receives a request-target longer than any URI it wishes to parse MUST respond with a 414 (URI Too Long) status code (see Section 15.5.15 of [HTTP]). Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-3-4

A client MUST send a Host header field (Section 7.2 of [HTTP]) in all HTTP/1.1 request messages. If the target URI includes an authority component, then a client MUST send a field value for Host that is identical to that authority component, excluding any userinfo subcomponent and its "@" delimiter (Section 4.2 of [HTTP]). If the authority component is missing or undefined for the target URI, then a client MUST send a Host header field with an empty field value.
