# memoize `f`.
# wraps f so that f will only be called once for every unique input.
#
# The term "memoization" was coined by Donald Michie in 1968 and
# is derived from the Latin word "memorandum" ("to be remembered"),
# usually truncated as "memo" in American English, and thus carries
# the meaning of "turning a function into something to be remembered".
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization
#
# example:
#
#     mem := memoize (lock_free.Map i32 String) i32 String x->
#       say "computing $x"
#       x.as_string
#
#     say <| mem 1
#     say <| mem 2
#     say <| mem 1
#     say <| mem 3
#

    store := MM.empty

    # implementation of abstract feature Unary.call
    #
    redef call(a T) R =>

      if store[a].is_nil
        store.add a (f a)
      store[a].get
