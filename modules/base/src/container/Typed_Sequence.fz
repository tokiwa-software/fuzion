# Typed_Sequence -- ancestor for features representing sequence of typed values
#
# Unlike `Sequence`, which contains values of all the same type, a `Typed_Sequence`
# contains values of different types.  This is similar to `Sequence Any`, only that
# values are not forced to be boxed into references.
#
# Actual implementations of this must provide an implementation of abstract feature
# `typed_foldf`.
#
# The desired way to use this feature is via calls to `typed_foldf` since this will
# avoid the creation of boxed `Typed_Value` instances.
#
# `Typed_Sequence` inherits from `Sequence Typed_Value` such that all the power of
# `Sequence` is available here, but at the cost of boxing into `Typed_Value`
# references values.
#
public Typed_Sequence ref : Sequence container.Typed_Value is


  # create a list from this Typed_Sequence.
  #
  # Note that this creates boxed ref instances of `Typed_Value`.  The preferred
  # means to acces the values is via a call to `typed_foldf`.
