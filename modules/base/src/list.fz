# list -- feature used to define lists
#
# list provides an abstract type for a sequence of elements of the same type.
#
# A list sequence may be empty and contain no element, or it may have a fixed
# or even an infinite number of elements.
#
# The core of the implementation of an actual list lies in the implementation
# of the actual Cons cell a non-empty list consists of.
#
# Lists can typically be traversed using only immutable data. This makes them
# more flexible than streams that require to store and update their state.
#
# A list is immutable, so it can be reused and shared between threads.
# Due to the nature of lists, in which many Cons cells are used, a list
# may require more (heap) allocation than an array.
#
#
#

# infix operator to create a list from head h and lazy tail t.
#
# This is convenient to append an element before a list as in
#
#   0 : [1,2,3,4].as_list
#
# or to create lists by recursion, e.g., a an endless list containing
# integer 1 repeatedly is
#
#   ones => 1 : ones

public infix : (A type, h A, t Lazy (list A)) =>

# infix operator to create a list from head h and a production
# function f
#
# This can be used, e.g., as follows:
#
# Ex1: the identity can be used to repeat the same element
#
#   1 :: x->x
#
# will create 1,1,1,1,...
#
# Ex2: To create a list of all integers, use
#
#   0 :: +1
#
# which will produce 0,1,2,3,4,5,...
#
# Ex3: The call
#
#   1 :: p->p+p
#
# will produce the powers of two: 1,2,4,8,16,32,...
