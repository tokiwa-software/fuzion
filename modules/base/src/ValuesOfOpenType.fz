# ValuesOfOpenType -- parent feature of type used for open types
#
# This is the parent feature of the result type of fields with open
# type such as `tuple.values` if called without selecting a particular
# variant such as `tuple.values.2`.
#
# The ValuesOfOpenType value inherits from `TypedSequence` permitting access to
# the types and values of the individual fields
#
module:public ValuesOfOpenType ref : TypedSequence is


  # fold the actual fields created for a field whose type is an open type parameter
  # using the given `TypeApplicator` `a` and initial value `e`.
  #
  # In case the actual open type parameter list is empty, the result is `e`.
