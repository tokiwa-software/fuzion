# unit type to group buffered io
#
# since a buffer requires mutation you must provide a (local) mutate
# effect that is instated to use any features working with buffers.
#
# Additionally, the mutate effect provides a means to distinguish
# different instances. Say you want to use buffered readers to read
# from two files simultaneously: You can create two different
# local mutate types `lm1` and `lm2` to distinguish the two
# readers.
