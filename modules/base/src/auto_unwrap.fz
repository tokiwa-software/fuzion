#  Source code of Fuzion standard library feature auto_unwrap
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# auto_unwrap adds compiler support for automatic unwrapping.
#
# this is used by e.g. concur.atomic, mutate.new
#
# example:
#
#     a := mut 3
#     a <- 4 + a   # no need to write a.get, compiler does this automatically.
