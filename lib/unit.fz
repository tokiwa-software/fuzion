# unit -- value to be used as result of features that do not return a result
#
# NOTE: unit corresponds to type void in C, Java, etc.
#
# unit is the preferred result type for features that return without producing
# a result value.  These are features that typically have an outside effect
# such as
#
#   println(String s) unit is ...
#
# or features that change the state of an instance such as
#
#   increment(delta i64) unit is
#     set counter := counter + delta
#
# The Fuzion language implementation automatically inserts code that returns the
# unit value as a result of these features, there is no need for an explicit unit
# result as in
#
#   increment(delta i64) unit is
#     set counter := counter + delta
#     unit
#
# but it is allowed to return unit explicitly if desired.
#
# Another application of the unit type are generic features when certain generic
# values are not needed and can be ignored.  An example could be a generic map
# implementation map<K,V> that maps values of type K to values of type V.  Using
# unit as the actual generic argument for V, e.g., map<string,unit> creates a
# map that stores no data for each key, which essentially turns the map into a
# set of the map's keys.
#
# The Fuzion library knows several different unit types.  Another example is nil,
# which is used as the alternative type in an option.  This enables the use of
# option<void>, which can store two distinct values, void and nil.
#
# Other unit types in Fuzion are TRUE and FALSE.
#
# The simplest syntax to create a value of unit type is an empty block '{}'. Note
# that an empty tuple 'tuple<>' is a different unit value of a different type and
# the syntax '()' is (at least for now) not supported.
#
# Please note the fundamental difference between
#
#   red is {}
#   red => {}
#
# The first declares a feature red that defines a new unit type red, the second
# declares a feature red with result type unit, i.e., a synonyme for unit as in
#
#   red unit is {}
#
# The memory required to store a value of unit type is 0 bits, so you can use
# plenty without worrying about space constraints.  The Fuzion code generators
# typically will not generate any code for returning or assiging a value of unit
# type, so these are very efficient as well.
