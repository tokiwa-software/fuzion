# Minimal example:
# ```
# rh : net.Request_Handler is
#   handle_request(chan net.channel) unit =>
#     say chan.read

# (net.request_handler rh).go ()->
#   net.client net.family.ipv4 net.protocol.tcp "tokiwa.software" 80
# ```
#
# Blocks until connection is establised.
# NYI blocking / none blocking
