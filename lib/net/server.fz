# server -- effect for storing a bound - and in the
# case of TCP, listening - socket descriptor.
#
# Basic usage description:
# 1) Initialize the server, e.g. like this:
# `server family.ipv4 protocol.tcp 8080`
# 2) Accept a connection:
# `server.accept`
# 3) Use the now installed channel for reading/writing.
# `(channel server).read ...` / `(channel server).write ...`
#
