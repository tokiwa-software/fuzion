  # NYI: The result of do_panic should be returned by `use`, but there is
  # currently no way we could do this.  One way would be to add a local
  # variable of type `Any` to `panic` and store the result there and then
  # cast it to the correct type in `use` (see
  # https://flang.dev/design/type_casts_ref)
  #

  # Install this panic handler using a new instance of panic and run
  # `code` on it. In case of an abort, return `def()` (NYI: def should be
  # removed and the result of do_panic should be returned instead).
