# Sequence -- ancestor for features that can be converted to a 'list' or a
# 'stream'
#
# Sequences are empty, finite or infinite ordered collections of instances
# of a given type.  Sequences may calculate elements lazily on demand.
#
# Sequence is a 'ref' type, i.e., different sub-features may be assigned
# to a field of type 'Sequence'.
#
# Heirs of Sequence must implement either 'as_list' or 'as_stream'.  Failure
# to implement any of these results in an endless recursion when the Sequence
# is used.
