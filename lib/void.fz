# void -- type with no values
#
# NOTE: For a counterpart to void in C, Java, etc., see unit.fz
#
# It is impossible to create any values of this type, consequently, it is impossible
# to assign anything to a field of void type.
#
# If used as the type of an argument field for a feature, the feature can never be
# called since no value assignable to that argument could ever be produced.  This
# produces an absurd feature.
#
# If used as the result type of a routine, the routine can never return.
#
# void is the result type of the endless loop
#
#   do { <loop body> }
#
# If used as the result type of a field, the field can never be assigned a value,
# since no such value can be produced, and the field can never be read since it
# remains not initialized forever.
#
# Type void is assignable to all other types, e.g, we can assign void to a value
# of type i32:
#
#   i i32 := fuzion.std.exit 1
#
# Since no value of type void can ever be produced, the assignment is dead code that
# will be removed by the fuzion implementation.
#
# Type void may be used as an actual generic argument for a generic feature.  If this
# is done, it will turn all features that have arguments of that type into absurd
# features.  Also, this will ensure that any feature that produces a result of that
# type to never return a result (typically to not be callable in the first place as
# well).  An example could be a stack of capacity zero: stack<void>(0) with an
# absurd
#
#   stack.push(void)
#
# and a pop function with a precondition that is always false
#
#   pop void
#     pre size > 0
#
# The memory required to store a value of void type is not defined since these
# values do not exist.  The Fuzion code generators typically will not generate
# any code for features receiving arguments of void type or for code following
# a feature call that returns void.
#

void(absurd void) is absurd

# NYI: possible alternative definitions base on choice types
#
# void : choice <> is
#
# void (absurd choice<>) is absurd
