# has_equality -- feature for immutable values that define an equality relation
#
has_equality is


  # equality implements the default equality relation for values of this type.
  #
  # This relation must be
  #
  #  - reflexive (equality a b),
  #  - symmetric (equality a b = equality b a), and
  #  - transitive ((equality a b && equality b c) : equality a c).
  #
  # result is true iff 'a' is considered to represent the same abstract value
  # as 'b'.
