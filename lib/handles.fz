# handles provide a means to create handles that refer to update-able
# cells.
#
# handles is a state monad.  It provides features to create several
# handles that refer to modifiable value and features to 'get', 'put' or
# 'update' this value.
#
# an example of using handles is shown below, handle (singular) is an
# alias to initialize a new handle with the given initial value. handle0 T
# is the type that allows passing around handles.
#
#     ex_handles is
#       hdl := handle 42
#     
#       say hdl.get
#     
#       x(h handle0 i32) unit is
#         b := hdl.put 17
#         say b
#         say hdl.get
#     
#       x hdl
#     
#       say hdl.get
#
# the example also shows the difference between handles and the mutate effect:
# while both provide a way to store and update a mutable value, a handle can be
# passed around between features. meanwhile, mutables are not a type that can be
# given to other features, only values can. handles essentially provide an
# abstraction of pointers, implemented natively in Fuzion.
#

  # using marray, reducing the overhead of an update from O(count) to O(1)!
