# safety -- condition qualifier for conditions that are required for safety
#
# safety is a condition qualifier that is used for conditions that are
# absolutely required to ensure safety.
#
# This must never be disabled if safety is of any concern. Applications
# run with safety disabled typically have security vulnerabilities that
# allow system takeover via manipulated input data.
#
# Currently, the value of this can be controlled by setting the fuzion.safety
# Java property when calling the fz tool, for example like this:
#
#     FUZION_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Dfuzion.safety=off" fz ex_safety.fz
#
# If the program is compiled, not interpreted, then the value of this option
# at compile time will be used.

safety bool is intrinsic
