#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Lazy has special compiler support.
# It can be used to require lazy evaluation of arguments.
#
# A good example is `or` in bool:
#     infix || (other Lazy bool) bool =>
#
# In the following example the expression
# `4+5>10` will never be executed:
#     true || 4+5>10
