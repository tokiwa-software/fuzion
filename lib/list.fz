# list -- feature used to define lists
#
# list provides an abstract type for a sequence of elements of the same type.
#
# A list sequence may be empty and contain no element, or it may have a fixed
# or even infitie number of elements.
#
# The core of the implementation of an actual list lies in the implementation
# of the actual Cons cell a non-empty list consists of.
#
# Lists can typically be traversed using only immutable data. This makes them
# more flexible than streams that require to store and update their state.
#
# A list is immutable, so it can be reused and shared between threads.
# Compared to a stream, a list may require more (heap) allocation.
#
#
