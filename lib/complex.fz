# complexes -- unit type defining features related to complex
#
# complexes is a unit type defining features related to complex but not
# requiring an instance.
#
# The plural form of complex is complexes or complices (archaic), according
# to https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-plural-of/complex.html, so we
# use complexes.

  # redef one  => fuzion.std.panic "NYI: complexes.one not implemented, needs to instantiate type arg E"


# complex -- returns value of unit type complexes
#
# This is a convenience feature that allows using, e.g.,
# 'complex<i32>.sum' to get the the monoid of (complex, infix +) instead of
# 'complexs.sum'.
#
# Since this complex with no arguments is a routine and not a constructor, it
# does not define a type (which would cause a name clash with complex with two
# arguments).
