# option -- feature wrapping a value or nothing
#
# option represents an optional value of type T
#
public option(T type) :
  choice T nil,
  monad T (option T)
is

  # Does this option contain a value of type T?
  #
  public exists => (option.this ? T   => true
                                | nil => false)


  # short-hand postfix operator for 'exists'
  #
  public postfix ?? => exists


  # Does this option contain no value of type T?
  #
  public is_nil => !exists


  # short-hand postfix operator for 'is_nil'
  #
  public postfix !! => is_nil


  # monadic operator
  #
  # This is handy to implement functions on optional values. As an example,
  # take an option string and you would like to add a filename suffix to
  # this string if it is present. Then you can do this as follows:
  #
  #   add_txt(o option string) => o >>= s -> s + ".txt"
  #
  # NYI: Should maybe have generic parameter B and result in option B
  #
  public redef infix >>= (f T -> option T) => option.this.bind f


  # monadic operator
  #
  # Same as non-generic >>=, but also maps to a different type B.
  #
  public bind(B type, f T -> option B) option B is
    option.this ? v T => f v
                | nil => nil


  # synonym for infix >>=
  public and_then (f T -> option T) => option.this >>= f


  # map this option using f, i.e., map nil to nil and any value v to f v
  #
  public map(B type, f T -> B) option B is
    option.this ? v T => f v
                | nil => nil


  # converts option to a string
  #
  # returns the result of $T for an option containing an instance
  # of T, alternatively returns $nil for an option that is nil.
  #
  public redef as_string String is
    option.this ? v T => $v
                | nil => $nil


  # unwraps an option that is known to contain a value
  #
  # this can only be called in cases where it is known for sure that this option
  # is not nil.  A runtime error will be created otherwise.
  #
  public get
  pre
    safety: option.this??
  =>
    option.this ? v T => v
                | nil => fuzion.std.panic "option.get called on nil"

  #
  public get(default Lazy T)
  =>
    option.this ? v T => v
                | nil => default


  # return function
  #
  public fixed type.return (a T) => option a


# option with 1 argument provides an short-hand to wrap a value into an option
#
# Using this enables to write
#
#   o := option x
#
# insted of
#
#   o option TypeOfX := x
