# outcome -- result type for functions that may return an error
#
# outcome is a choice type that represents the result of a routine that
# may either produce something useful or fail producing an error condition.
#
# Several error conditions are needed if there are several very different
# reasons for an operation to fail, e.g.
#
#   getData (u User, t Type) outcome data IOError PermissionError is
#     if u.allowedToAcces T
#       (readFile t.fileName)?
#     else
#       PermissionError u, t
#
#   readFile t Type outcome data IOError is
#     [..]
#
# Note that 'outcome data IOError' is not assignment compatible with
# 'outcome data IOError PermissionError', it has to be unwrapped first.
# This unwrapping, however, requires very little boilerplate, it is done
# using the '?' on the result of the call to 'readFile': This unwraps
# 'outcome data IOError' into 'IOError', which would be returned abruptly,
# and 'data', which would be returned normally. Both are assignment
# compatible to  'outcome data IOError PermissionError', so everything
# is fine.
#
outcome(T type) : choice T error /* ...  NYI: this should be open generic! */ is

  # Does this outcome contain a value of type T?
  #
  ok => (outcome.this ? T     => true
                      | error => false)


  # short-hand postfix operator for 'ok'
  #
  postfix ?? => ok


  # Does this outcome contain an error
  #
  isError => !ok


  # short-hand postfix operator for 'isError'
  #
  postfix !! => isError


  # value of an outcome that is known to contain a value
  #
  # This can only be called in cases where it is known for sure that this
  # outcomee is not an error.  A runtime error will be created otherwise.
  #
  val T
    pre
      safety: outcome.this??

                 | error => default

  # "--$e--" for e error.
  #
  redef asString =>
    outcome.this ? v T     => v.asString
                 | e error => "--$e--"

  # returns o if outcome is ok, otherwise return the outcome's own
  # error.
  and (O type, o outcome O) outcome O is
    outcome.this ? _ T     => o
                 | e error => e

  # returns o if outcome is not ok, otherwise return this outcome's value.

# outcome with 1 argument provides an short-hand to wrap a value into a
