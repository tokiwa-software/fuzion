# outcome -- result type for functions that may return an error
#
# outcome is a choice type that represents the result of a routine that
# may either produce something useful or fail producing an error condition.
#
# Several error conditions are needed if there are several very different
# reasons for an operation to fail, e.g.
#
#   get_data (u User, t Type) outcome data IO_Error Permission_Error is
#     if u.allowed_to_acces T
#       (read_file t.file_name)?
#     else
#       Permission_Error u, t
#
#   read_file t Type outcome data IO_Error is
#     [..]
#
# Note that 'outcome data IO_Error' is not assignment compatible with
# 'outcome data IO_Error Permission_Error', it has to be unwrapped first.
# This unwrapping, however, requires very little boilerplate, it is done
# using the '?' on the result of the call to 'read_file': This unwraps
# 'outcome data IO_Error' into 'IO_Error', which would be returned abruptly,
# and 'data', which would be returned normally. Both are assignment
# compatible to  'outcome data IO_Error Permission_Error', so everything
# is fine.

  # monadic operator
  #
  # This enables a very idiomatic way of error handling: assume you are trying
  # to read 42 bytes from a file into a string. Let open be a feature that takes
  # a file name and returns an outcome of some abstract file descriptor, let read
  # be a feature that takes an abstract file descriptor and a number of bytes to
  # read and returns an outcome of a byte (u8) array. We want to read 42 bytes
  # from a file called "example.txt" into a string, and we wrap this into an outcome,
  # for handling the case that an error occurs when opening the file (i.e. it does
  # not exist) or when reading the file (i.e. example.txt is not actually a file but
  # a directory). Using match expressions, this is very cumbersome:
  #
  #     # open example file
  #     match open "example.txt"
  #       fd i64 =>
  #         # read 42 bytes from example file
  #         match read fd 42
  #           content array u8 => strings.from_bytes content
  #           re error => re
  #       oe error => oe
  #
  # The monadic operator turns this into:
  #
  #     (open "example.txt").bind (array u8) (fd->read fd 42)
  #

# outcome with 1 argument provides an short-hand to wrap a value into a
# outcome
#
# Using this enables to write

#   o := outcome x
