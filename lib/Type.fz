# Type -- parent feature of all type features
#
# type features 'f.type' are declared implicitly for every feature f.
# Type features do not contain state, they are unit types.
#
# All type features inherit directly (Object.type) or indirectly (all
# others type features) from this feature.
#
Type ref is


  # name of this type, including type parameters, e.g. 'option (list i32)'.
  #
  name string is intrinsic


  # string representation of this type to be used for debugging.

  # result has the form "Type of '<name>'", but this might change in the future
