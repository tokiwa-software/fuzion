# Type -- parent feature of all type features
#
# type features 'f.type' are declared implicitly for every feature f.
# Type features do not contain state, they are unit types.
#
Type ref is


  # name of this type, including type parameters, e.g. 'option (list i32)'.
  #
  name string is abstract


  # string representation of this type to be used for debugging.
  #
  # result has the form "Type of '<name>'", but this might change in the future
  #
  redef asString => "Type of '$name'"


# Types -- features related to Type but not requiring an instance of Type
#
Types is

  # Get the Type instance corresponding to a given type
  #
  # The result of 'Types.get x' is the same as 'x.type'.
  # Internally, Fuzion's front end implements 'x.type' using
  # 'Types.get x'.
