# psSet -- a partially sorted set based on psMap
#
# psSet is a persistent set of ordered values.  This set is generally
# well-behaved with respect to cumulative and average performance.
#
# WARNING: Due to the high worst-case time for addition, this structure should
# not be used in situations when adding a single element repeatedly to the same
# instance of psSet is performance critical. If the resulting set's size n is a
# power of 2, this will trigger the worst-case addition time resutling in
# O(m*n log² n) for adding an element m times.
