module misc is


  # intrinsic to get a unique id > 0
  #
  # this can be used to add a unique identifier to compare instances.
  #
  # sine there are 2^64-1 possible values, you can safely assume that these are
  # in fact unique.  Assuming one unique id is consumed every nanosecond, it
  # would take more than 500 years before we run out of values
  # (2^64/10^9/3600/24/365.25).
