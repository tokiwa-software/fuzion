# debug -- features related to debug setting
#
# debug is a condition qualifier that enables conditions if debugging is
# enabled.
#
# this is true if and only if the debug level is greater than zero.
#
debug bool is intrinsic  # 0 < debugLevel   , intrinsic only to allow compiler to kick out debug code earlier


# debug(i32) is a condition qualifier that enables conditions if debugging is
# enabled at the given debug-level.
#
debug(n i32) => n <= debugLevel


# Current debug level, used by condition qualified debug(i32)
#
# This can be controlled using the "-debug=" option to the fz tool:
#
#     fz -debug=0 ex_debug.fz
#     fz -debug=3 -c ex_debug.fz
#
# Whatever option was set at compile time will be used when running a
# compile program.
#
debugLevel i32 is intrinsic
