# id -- routine implementing the identity function

# identity -- feature returing the unary identity function
#
# When called, this feature returns a unary function that implements the
# identity for the given type.
#
# In most cases, you can use `id` instead and rely on partial application to
# create a Function instance, e.g. you can use any of these to produce the same
# result

#   all_true(s Sequence bool) => s ∀ id
#   all_true(s Sequence bool) => s ∀ (x -> id bool x)
#   all_true(s Sequence bool) => s ∀ (x -> id x)
#   all_true(s Sequence bool) => s ∀ (identity bool)
#
# or, using an intermediate field,
#
#   all_true(s Sequence bool) => f (bool)->bool := id;               s ∀ f
