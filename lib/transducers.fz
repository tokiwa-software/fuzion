# transducers map one reducing function to another

# see https://clojure.org/reference/transducers
# for in depth information about transducers
#
# usage example:
#
# human(age i32) is
# ages := map (Sequence i32) human i32 (x -> x.age)
# gt_ten := filter (Sequence i32) i32 (x -> x > 10)
# xf := ages ∘ gt_ten
# say ([human(4), human(12), human(30)].into xf) # [12,30]
transducers is

  filter(TA,T type, predicate T -> bool) Transducer(TA,T,T) is
    Transducer(TA,T,T, (red) -> (res, val) -> if predicate val then red.call res val else res)


  # a transducer mappping values from T to U
  map(TA,T,U type, mapper T -> U) Transducer(TA,U,T) is
    Transducer(TA,U,T, ((red) -> ((res, val) -> red.call res (mapper val))))


  # left-to-right composition of transducers
  compose(TA,A,B,C type, a Transducer(TA,B,C), b Transducer(TA,A,B)) =>
    a ∘ b
