# this opens a directory and installs the (open T) effect to be used
# in `code()`.
#
# type parameter T is used to distinguish between several open
# directories.
#
# usage example:
#
#     use some_type path ()->
#       match (open some_type).read
#         e error => e
#         s String => say s
#
public use(T, R type, path String, code ()-> outcome R) outcome R =>
  (fuzion.sys.fileio.open_dir path).bind R fd->
    # install effect `open T` and run `code`
    r := open T fd path
       ! code
    # close file
    _ := fuzion.sys.fileio.close_dir fd
    # return result
    r


# short hand for use when
# it is not necessary to distinguish between opens
#
# usage example:
#
#     use path ()->
#       match open.read
#         e error => e
#         s String => say s
#
public use(R type, path String, code ()-> outcome R) outcome R =>
  use open_unique_type R path code
