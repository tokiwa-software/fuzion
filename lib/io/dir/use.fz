# this opens a directory and installs the (open T) effect to be used
# in `code()`.
#
# type parameter T is used to distinguish between several open
# directories.
#
# usage example:
# ```
# use some_type path ()->
#   match (open some_type).read
#     e error => e
#     s String => say s
# ```
public use(T, R type, path String, code ()-> outcome R) outcome R =>
  match fuzion.sys.fileio.open_dir path
    fd i64 =>
      # install effect `open T` and run `code`
      r := open T fd path
        .go code
      # close file
      fuzion.sys.fileio.close_dir fd
      # return result
      r
    e error =>
      e


# short hand for use when
# it is not necessary to distinguish between opens
#
# usage example:
# ```
# use path ()->
#   match open.read
#     e error => e
#     s String => say s
# ```
