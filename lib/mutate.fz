# mutate -- an effect that permits creation and mutation of mutable values.
#
# This effect is typically used to work with mutable values. You can create
# a mutable value as follows
#
#   v := mutate.env.new i32 42
#
# and then modify it using
#
#   v <- 666
#
# To read it, call 'get' as in
#
#   say "v is {v.get}"
#
# Convenience feature 'mut' and type inference allow the creation to be
# written as
#
#   v := mut 42
#
# NYI: syntax sugar to read mutable field using
#
#   w := v + 1
#
# instead of
#
#   w := v.get + 1
#
# is not supported yet.
