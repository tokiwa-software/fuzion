# monad -- generic monad
#
# A monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X, with
# product × replaced by composition of endofunctors and unit set by the
# identity endofunctor.
#       -- Saunder Mac Lane, Categories for the Working Mathematician, 1971
#
# Don't be scared, in Java terms: A monad is a means to compose functions
# applied to generic types.
#
#
monad<A, MA: monad<A, MA>> is


  # monadic operator within the same monad
  #
  # Apply f to elements of type A and re-wrap them in this monad.
  #
  infix >>= (f A -> MA) MA is abstract


  # monadic operator to another monad
  #
  # Apply f to elements of type A and wrap them in MB.
  #
  # NYI: This is currently useless since a redefinition is not
  # allowed for features with generic arguments. Is there a way
  # we could allow this anyway?
  #
  infix >>=~ <B, MB> (f A -> MB) MB is abstract


  # join operator
  #
  # NYI: useless since redefinition currently not supported for
  # feature with generics.
  #
  join <MMA : monad<MA, monad<A, MA>>> (a MMA) MA is abstract


  # return function
  #
  # NYI: This should be A -> MA, not MA x A -> MA as it is right now
  # since it needs an instance to be called on.
  #
  return (a A) MA is abstract


  # NYI: fmap:
  #
  # fmap<B> (f A -> B) is monad.this >>= fun (x A) B is return f x
