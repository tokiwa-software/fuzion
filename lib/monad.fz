# monad -- generic monad
#
# A monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X, with
# product Ã— replaced by composition of endofunctors and unit set by the
# identity endofunctor.
#       -- Saunder Mac Lane, Categories for the Working Mathematician, 1971
#
# Don't be scared, in Java terms: A monad is a means to compose functions
# applied to generic types.
#
#
public monad (A type, MA type : monad A MA) is


  # monadic operator within the same monad
  #
  # Apply f to elements of type A and re-wrap them in this monad.
  #
  public infix >>= (f A -> MA) MA is abstract


  # monadic operator to another monad
  #
  # Apply f to elements of type A and wrap them in MB.
  #
  # NYI: This is currently useless since a redefinition is not
  # allowed for features with generic arguments. Is there a way
  # we could allow this anyway?

  # join operator

  # NYI: useless since redefinition currently not supported for
