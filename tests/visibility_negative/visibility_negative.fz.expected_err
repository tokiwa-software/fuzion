---------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A lambda expression can only be used if assigned to a field or argument of type 'Function'
with argument count of the lambda expression equal to the number of type parameters of the type.  The type of the
assigned field must be given explicitly.
To solve this, declare an explicit type for the target field, e.g., 'f (i32, i32) -> bool := x, y -> x > y'.
