test_tailrecursion =>

  # a tailrecursion that cannot be optimized
  #
  # we check that the instance of `f` is not reused if it is made accessible
  # from outside via an inner instance.
  #
  # Note that we could try to force a stack overflow here by setting the termination
  # condition `a < 200` to something like `a < 10000000`. This works for the JVM backend,
  # but the C backend currently allocates instances of `f` on the heap such that the C
  # compiler can still optimize tail recursion and we do not get a stack overflow. Also,
  # would be a little weird to have a test that _on success_ would result in a stack
  # overflow...
