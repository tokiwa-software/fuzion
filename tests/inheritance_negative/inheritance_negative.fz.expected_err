--CURDIR--/inheritance_negative.fz:33:5: error 1: Recursive value type is not allowed
    u : strm2 is # 1. should flag an error, inheritance of outer feature not permitted for value type
----^
Value type inheritance_negative.strm2.u equals type of outer feature.
The chain of outer types that lead to this recursion is:
1: inheritance_negative.strm2.u at --CURDIR--/inheritance_negative.fz:33:5:
    u : strm2 is # 1. should flag an error, inheritance of outer feature not permitted for value type
----^
2: inheritance_negative.strm2.u at --CURDIR--/inheritance_negative.fz:33:5:
    u : strm2 is # 1. should flag an error, inheritance of outer feature not permitted for value type
----^

To solve this, you could add a 'ref' after the arguments list at --CURDIR--/inheritance_negative.fz:33:5:
    u : strm2 is # 1. should flag an error, inheritance of outer feature not permitted for value type
----^
