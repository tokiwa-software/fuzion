# This exmaple contains code that resulted in fz command crashing with a failing
# require condition (or null pointer in case checkds were not enabled).
#
# The problem was a call to a field `o.v` that is declared of a type parameter that is set
# via inheritance of the actual type of the target `o` of the call.  If the underlying feature
# `s` was not resolved yet, the type of `v` was not set correctly.
