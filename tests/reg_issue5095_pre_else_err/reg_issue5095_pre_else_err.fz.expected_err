      pre true          # 1. should flag an error: implicit `pre true` inherited
------^^^^^^^^
'test_1.child_1.foo' redefines features 'test_1.grandparent.foo' and 'test_1.parent_2.foo' which do not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue5095_pre_else_err.fz:46:7: error 2: Precodition added, although implicit 'pre true' was inherited
      pre else true     # 2. should flag an error: implicit `pre true` inherited
------^^^^^^^^^^^^^
'test_1.child_2.foo' redefines features 'test_1.grandparent.foo' and 'test_1.parent_2.foo' which do not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.

      pre true          # 3. should flag an error: implicit `pre true` inherited
------^^^^^^^^
'test_1.child_3.bar' redefines feature 'test_1.parent_2.bar' which does not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.

      pre else true     # 4. should flag an error: implicit `pre true` inherited
------^^^^^^^^^^^^^
'test_1.child_4.bar' redefines feature 'test_1.parent_2.bar' which does not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.

------^^^^^^^^
'test_1.child_5.foo' redefines feature 'test_1.grandparent.foo' which does not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.

------^^^^^^^^^^^^^
'test_1.child_6.foo' redefines feature 'test_1.grandparent.foo' which does not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.

      pre true          # 7. should flag an error: implicit `pre true` inherited (see #5149)
------^^^^^^^^
'test_2.child_1.foo' redefines feature 'test_2.parent_2.foo' which does not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.

'test_2.child_2.foo' redefines feature 'test_2.parent_2.foo' which does not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue5095_pre_else_err.fz:112:7: error 9: Precondition must use 'else' in a feature that redefines another feature with a precondition.
      pre true          # 9. should flag an error: else missing
------^^^^^^^^
Affected feature: 'test_2.child_3.bar'
Redefines: 'test_2.parent_2.bar' from --CURDIR--/reg_issue5095_pre_else_err.fz:90:7:
      pre true
------^^^^^^^^
To solve this, check if you are accidentally redefining another feature or, if you intend to redefine, add the 'else' keyword 


--CURDIR--/reg_issue5095_pre_else_err.fz:124:7: error 10: Precondition must use 'else' in a feature that redefines another feature with a precondition.
      pre true          # 10. should flag an error: else missing
------^^^^^^^^
Affected feature: 'test_2.child_5.foo'
Redefines: 'test_2.parent_1.foo' from --CURDIR--/reg_issue5095_pre_else_err.fz:84:9:
        pre else true
--------^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To solve this, check if you are accidentally redefining another feature or, if you intend to redefine, add the 'else' keyword 


--CURDIR--/reg_issue5095_pre_else_err.fz:162:7: error 11: Precodition added, although implicit 'pre true' was inherited

'test_4.child.foo' redefines feature 'test_4.parent_2.foo' which does not have an explicit precondition, leading to implicit 'pre true' being inherited, which results in this precondition never being called. Preconditions can only be weakened in the redefinition.
To solve this remove the precondition or add one to all features being redefined.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue5095_pre_else_err.fz:172:5: error 12: Precondition must use 'else' only in a feature that redefines another feature with a precondition.
    pre else true       # 12. should flag an error: must not use else
----^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Surrounding feature: 'test_5.other_1.foo'
To solve this, check if you are properly redefining another feature or, if you do not intend to do so, remove the 'else' keyword
