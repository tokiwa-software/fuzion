# the example from issue #2182:
#
# This is not called, the error was in the front end that did not need
# a call
#
test_fib1 =>

  # this example was moved to reg_issue2182_negative
  # fib(a) => list a (fib a)

# a more useful fibonacci number generator that showed the same problem:
#
test_fib2 =>

  # `fib a b` produces a list of fibonacci numbers starting with a and b
  fib(a,b) => list a (fib b a+b)

  # create an instance of this list starting with 1 1
  fib0 := fib (u64 1) (u64 1)

  # create fibonacci as a Unary function
  fib := fib0[]

  # use `fib`
  for i in 0..50 do
    say "$i:{fib i}"
