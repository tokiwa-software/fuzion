    type.x(a e.this) => $a.me   # 1. should flag an error: `Call has an ambiguous result type...`
-------------------------^^^^
The result type of this call depends on the target type.  Since the target type is a 'ref' type that may represent a number of different actual dynamic types, the result type is not clearly defined.
Called feature: 'case1.e.me'
Original result type: 'case1.e.this'
Type depending on target: 'case1.e.this'
Target type: 'case1.p.this'
To solve this, you could try to use a value type as the target type of the call, e,g., 'case1.e', or change the result type of 'case1.e.me' to no longer depend on 'case1.e.this'.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue4273.fz:65:26: error 2: Call has an ambiguous result type since target of the call is a 'ref' type.
    type.x(a e.this) => $a.me   # 2. should flag an error: `Call has an ambiguous result type...`
-------------------------^^^^
The result type of this call depends on the target type.  Since the target type is a 'ref' type that may represent a number of different actual dynamic types, the result type is not clearly defined.
Called feature: 'case3.e.me'
Original result type: 'option case3.e.this'
Type depending on target: 'case3.e.this'
Target type: 'case3.p.this'
To solve this, you could try to use a value type as the target type of the call, e,g., 'case3.e', or change the result type of 'case3.e.me' to no longer depend on 'case3.e.this'.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue4273.fz:85:17: error 3: Call has an ambiguous result type since target of the call is a 'ref' type.
    redef s => $me              # 4. should flag an error: `Call has an ambiguous result type...`
----------------^^
The result type of this call depends on the target type.  Since the target type is a 'ref' type that may represent a number of different actual dynamic types, the result type is not clearly defined.
Called feature: 'case4.e.me'
Original result type: 'option case4.e.this'
Type depending on target: 'case4.e.this'
Target type: 'case4.p.this'
To solve this, you could try to use a value type as the target type of the call, e,g., 'case4.e', or change the result type of 'case4.e.me' to no longer depend on 'case4.e.this'.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue4273.fz:84:17: error 4: Call has an ambiguous result type since target of the call is a 'ref' type.
    redef me => option e.this   # 3. should flag an error: `Call has an ambiguous result type...`
----------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The result type of this call depends on the target type.  Since the target type is a 'ref' type that may represent a number of different actual dynamic types, the result type is not clearly defined.
Called feature: 'option'
Original result type: 'option case4.e.this'
Type depending on target: 'case4.e.this'
Target type: 'case4.p.this'
To solve this, you could try to use a value type as the target type of the call, e,g., 'universe', or change the result type of 'option' to no longer depend on 'case4.e.this'.
