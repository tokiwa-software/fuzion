# the example from issue #2214 and variants
#
# The problem in all these examples is that a feature (a.m, map_broken)
#



# the original code from issue #2214, only added is some output and a `call` to
# avoid missing implementation error:

  a(T type) is
    m(B type, f T->B) : a B is
      say "T is $T"
      say "B is $B"
