    # the original code form the issue:
    #
    # The problem was that during monomorphizaiton, for the co-type of the
    # feature generated for the lambda expression `_->`, the inherits call
    # includes a call to `Unary.type e.λ.this.type unit e.this` and the
    # last type parameter `e.this` was not monomorphized, i.e., was not
    # replaced by `e`.
    #
    e is
     i(def e.this -> unit) =>
        (option unit).get
     i  _->
    _ := e


  simplified =>

    # slightly simplified code created while tracking down this problem
    #
    e is
     i(def Function e.this) =>
        _ := (option unit nil).count
     i ()->do
    _ := e
