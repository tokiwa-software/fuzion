f l => l (do)
---------^^^^
Declared features:
declared 'f.loop' at --CURDIR--/reg_issue1666.fz:27:13:
f l => l (do)
------------^
This is an implementation restriction that should be removed in a future version of Fuzion.

To solve this, create a helper feature 'lazy_value' that calculates the value as follows:

  lazy_value => {
  private loop ***not yet known*** : Any is routine
  f.this.loop
}

and then use 'lazy_value' as instead of the original expression.

one error.
