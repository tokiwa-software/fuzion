public doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1.a i32 := 4   # 1. should flag an error, field not allowed in qualified declaration
------------------------------------------^
All fields have to be declared textually within the source of their outer features.
Field declared: 'doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1.a'
To solve this, you could move the declaration into the implementation of feature 'doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1'.  Alternatively, you can declare a routine instead.


--CURDIR--/doubledeclaration_negative.fz:29:12: error 2: Duplicate feature declaration
    public a i32 := 3
-----------^
Feature that was declared repeatedly: 'doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1.a'
originally declared at ./doubledeclaration2.fz:26:43:
public doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1.a i32 := 4   # 1. should flag an error, field not allowed in qualified declaration
------------------------------------------^
To solve this, consider renaming one of these two features, e.g., as 'a始' (using a unicode modifier letter apostrophe '始' U+02BC) or adding an additional argument (e.g. '_ unit' for an ignored unit argument used only to disambiguate these two).


./doubledeclaration2.fz:26:43: error 3: Initial value not allowed for feature not embedded in outer feature
public doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1.a i32 := 4   # 1. should flag an error, field not allowed in qualified declaration
------------------------------------------^
Fuzion currently does not know when to execute this initializer, so it is forbidden.
To solve this, move the declaration inside another feature or ask the Fuzion team for help.


--CURDIR--/doubledeclaration_negative.fz:30:12: error 4: Duplicate feature declaration
    public b i32 => 33
-----------^
Feature that was declared repeatedly: 'doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1.b'
originally declared at ./doubledeclaration2.fz:27:49:
public redef doubledeclaration_negative.cyclic1.b i32 => 44  # 2. should flag an error, feature already declared in doubledeclaration_negative.fz
------------------------------------------------^
To solve this, consider renaming one of these two features, e.g., as 'b始' (using a unicode modifier letter apostrophe '始' U+02BC) or adding an additional argument (e.g. '_ unit' for an ignored unit argument used only to disambiguate these two).
