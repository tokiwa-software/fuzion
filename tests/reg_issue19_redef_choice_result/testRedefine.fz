# Regression test for #19: https://github.com/tokiwa-software/fuzion/issues/19

# A simple negative test for redefining the result type of a feature.  This
# should report errors for the redefinitions bad1.get and bad2.get.
#
# The test should be run and its output should be compared to the expected
# output.
