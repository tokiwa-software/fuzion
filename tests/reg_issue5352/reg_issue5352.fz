# partial application of an empty (or effectively empty) block

reg_issue5352 =>

  # a feature expecting a Nullary that produces unit type
  q(f ()->unit) =>
    say "in q, calling f"
    f()
    say "in q, called f"

  # original test from #5352: since the field `_` is unused, it will be removed
  # creating an empty block
  q ({_:=1})

  # same thing, but using an empty block right way
  q ({})

  # same thing, but using an empty block right way
  q ({_ := ignore (say "this should run")})
