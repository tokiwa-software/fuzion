effect environment '--empty--' for call to 'universe'
effect environment '--empty--' at program entry

To fix this, you should make sure that an effect for type 'mutate' is instated along all call paths to this effect use.

Alternatively, you might want to try setting env variable 'dev_flang_fuir_analysis_dfa_TRACE_ALL_EFFECT_ENVS=true'.  This will increase the analysis accuracy for effects, but may take a long time.
