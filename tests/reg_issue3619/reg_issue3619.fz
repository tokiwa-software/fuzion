  # here is the code from #3619

  r(T type, v T) is

  A ref is
    f(p r A.this) b => b

  b : A is
    redef fixed f(p r b) => p.v

  a A := b
  x b := a.f (r A)

  # `r` contains a value of type `T`, so `r A` contains a value of type `A`.
  #
  # `A.f(p r A.this)` returns a value of type `b`, which in `b` is implemented
  # to return the value `v` stored in `p` which is of type `r b` in this case.
  #
  # Now we can call `a.f (r A)` where `a` is a `ref` to an instance of `b` that
  # would extract a `b` from `r A`, which is impossible.

  # here is a second example introduced as a comment added in PR #1426:

  r2 ref is
    e is
    g => e

  h1 : r2 is
  h2 : r2 is

  v r2 := if random.next_bool then h1 else h2
  x2 := v.g

  # The problem is that `v` may refer to `h1` or `h2` such that `v.g` will
  # result in either `h1.e` or `h2.e`.
