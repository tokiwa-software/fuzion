--CURDIR--/reg_issue3619.fz:41:12: error 1: Call has an ambiguous argument type since target of the call is a 'ref' type.
  _ b := a.f (r A)
-----------^
The argument type of this call depends on the target type.  Since the target type is a 'ref' type that may represent a number of different actual dynamic types, the argument type is not clearly defined.
Called feature: 'reg_issue3619.A.f'
Original argument type: 'reg_issue3619.this.r reg_issue3619.this.A.this' declared at --CURDIR--/reg_issue3619.fz:35:9:
    f(p r A.this) b => b
--------^
Type depending on target: 'reg_issue3619.this.A.this'
Target type: 'reg_issue3619.this.A'
To solve this, you could try to use a value type as the target type of the call or change the argument type of 'reg_issue3619.A.f' to no longer depend on 'reg_issue3619.this.A.this'.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue3619.fz:64:10: error 2: Call has an ambiguous result type since target of the call is a 'ref' type.
  _ := v.g
---------^
The result type of this call depends on the target type.  Since the target type is a 'ref' type that may represent a number of different actual dynamic types, the result type is not clearly defined.
Called feature: 'reg_issue3619.r2.g'
Original result type: 'reg_issue3619.this.r2.this.e'
Type depending on target: 'reg_issue3619.this.r2.this'
Target type: 'reg_issue3619.this.r2'
To solve this, you could try to use a value type as the target type of the call or change the result type of 'reg_issue3619.r2.g' to no longer depend on 'reg_issue3619.this.r2.this'.
