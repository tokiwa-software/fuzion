--CURDIR--/reg_issue4549.fz:24:26: error 1: Ambiguity between direct and partially applied call target
s(a, b) => s := [1].map (s 1)
-------------------------^
This call can be resolved in two ways, either as a direct call to 's' declared at --CURDIR--/reg_issue4549.fz:25:1:
s(a) =>
^
or by partially applying arguments to a call to 's' declared at --CURDIR--/reg_issue4549.fz:24:1:
s(a, b) => s := [1].map (s 1)
^.
To solve this, rename one of the ambiguous features.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue4549.fz:24:3: error 2: Type inference from actual arguments failed since no actual call was found
s(a, b) => s := [1].map (s 1)
--^
For the formal argument 's.a' the type can only be derived if there is a call to 's'.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue4549.fz:24:6: error 3: Type inference from actual arguments failed since no actual call was found
s(a, b) => s := [1].map (s 1)
-----^
For the formal argument 's.b' the type can only be derived if there is a call to 's'.
