reg_issue4964 =>

  some_local_feature => say "local feature in the test"

  ex is
    bar1 := "bar"
    addfoo1 := ref : String is
                public redef utf8 Sequence u8 => "foo".utf8 ++ bar1.utf8  # ok: indented further than `ref`

    say addfoo1

    bar2 := "bar"
    addfoo2 := ref : String is
      public redef utf8 Sequence u8 => "foo".utf8 ++ bar2.utf8  # should flag an error: inconsistent indentation

    # NYI: there are several succeeding errors caused by the broken indentation, if possible they should be avoided
    #      by improving the by improving heuristic on parsing the remaining code in the file

    say addfoo2       # NYI: does flag "inconsistent indentation" and "not found" errors that should be avoided

  some_local_feature  # NYI: does flag "inconsistent indentation" and "not found" errors that should be avoided
