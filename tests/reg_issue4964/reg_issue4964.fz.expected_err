--CURDIR--/reg_issue4964.fz:37:20: error 4: Feature declared using modifier 'redef' does not redefine another feature
      public redef utf8 Sequence u8 => "foo".utf8 ++ bar2.utf8  # should flag an error: inconsistent indentation
-------------------^^^^
Redefining feature: 'reg_issue4964.ex.utf8'
To solve this, check spelling and argument count against the feature you want to redefine or remove 'redef' modifier in the declaration of 'reg_issue4964.ex.utf8'.
Also make sure that the feature to be redefined is visible where it is redefined. There is the feature 'reg_issue4964.ex.utf8' that could be made public to allow redefinition in 'reg_issue4964.ex'.
