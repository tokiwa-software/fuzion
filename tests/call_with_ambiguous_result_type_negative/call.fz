# This tests a tricky call situation where the result type of a call is ambiguous
# since the outer type is a ref this.type that could be a boxed value type.
#
call_with_ambiguous_result_type is

  r ref is
    e is

    # result type of g is r.this.type.e
    g => e

  h1 : r is
  h2 : r is

  # v will be set to `boxed h1` or `boxed h2`
  v r := if time.nano.read % 2 = 1 then
           h1
         else
           h2

  # the result type of `v.g` is ambiguous: `h.e` for any
  # heir of `r`.  So this will cause an error:
  #
  x := v.g   # error! ambiguous result type
