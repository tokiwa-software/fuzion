# Regression test for #26: https://github.com/tokiwa-software/fuzion/issues/26
#
# A simple test that redefines a feature to return void
#
# The test should be run and its output should be compared to the expected
# output.

  f string is abstract
  res := f
  say "FAILED: $res!"

 h : p is

  # void is assignment compatible to anything, so we can redefine f
  # to return void!

  redef f void is
    say "PASSED: exiting f that was redefined to return void."
    exit 0
