/*
  We have the following possibilities when calling a feature `f` declared in do `on`
  actual outer clazz `oa`:

  inheritsCall: called normally or as a direct parent

     # f called normally
     r := oa.f

     # f called as parent
     g : oa.f is

  function/constructor: f may be a constructor or a function.

     on is
       # function f
       f result_type is
         stmnts

     on is
       # constructor f
       f is
         stmnts

  declared for value / declared for ref: `on` may be a `ref` instance

     # f declared for value
     on is
       f ... is
         stmnts
     # f declared for ref
     on ref is
       f ... is
         stmnts

  called on value / ref / boxed: `oa` is a value instance, a ref instance, a boxed value instance

     # f called on value:
     oa : on is ...
     t := oa
     r := t.f

     # f called on ref:
     oa ref : on is ...
     t := oa
     r := t.f

     # f called on boxed:
     oa : on is ...
     t ref oa := oa
     r := t.f

  So we have the following combinations

  * normal (non-inherits) call
    * function
      * declared for value
        * called on value
          - oa.f
        * called on ref

        * called on value
          - oa.f
        * called on ref

          - oa.f    result type is on.f?
        * called on boxed

  * inherits call
    * function -- not allowed
    * constructor
      - same as for normal (non-inherits) call
