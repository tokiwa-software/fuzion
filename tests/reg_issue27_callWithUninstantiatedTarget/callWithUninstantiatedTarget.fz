# Regression test for #27: https://github.com/tokiwa-software/fuzion/issues/27
#
# A simple test that creates a call to a target that is never instantiated
#
# The test should be run and its output should be compared to the expected
# output.
#
callWithUninstantiatedTarget is

  # x is declared to return y, but never returns
  #
  x y is
    say "x takes the back door out"
    exit 0

  # y is only used as a type, never instantiated
  #
  y is

    # y.z is never called and not compiled!
    #
    z is say "z!"

  # y0 will never be set since x will not return
  y0 := x;

  # so this call is dead code
  say "this is dead code"

  # and y.z does not even need to exist
  y0.z
