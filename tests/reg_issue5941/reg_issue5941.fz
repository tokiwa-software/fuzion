# a feature with open type parameters `V` is inherited from a feature with
# type parameters, which used to mess up the actual types assigned types.
#
reg_issue5941 =>

  # example code from #5941
  #
  p(X type) is

    f(V type..., v V...) =>

  # using inheritance
  h : p unit is
  h.f

  # --- more tests that go beyond the example from #5941:

  # no inheritance
  #
  (p unit).f

  # complex inheritance
  h2 : Sequence (f64,bool), h, unit is
    public redef as_string String => "h2"
  h2.f

  # --- same thing but with output and using actual type pars for `f`

  # example code from #5941
  #
  q(X type) is

    f(V type..., v V...) => say v

  # using inheritance
  hq : q unit is
  hq.f
  hq.f "hi"
  hq.f true u8.zero "X"

  # --- more tests that go beyond the example from #5941:

  # no inheritance
  #
  (q unit).f
  (q unit).f "hi"
  (q unit).f true u8.zero "X"

  # complex inheritance
  hq2 : Sequence (f64,bool), hq, unit is
    public redef as_string String => "h2"
  hq2.f
  hq2.f "hi"
  hq2.f true u8.zero "X"
