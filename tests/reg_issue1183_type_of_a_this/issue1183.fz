issue1183 is

  # our own implementation of type_of for this test:
  #
  my_type_of(T type, _ T) => T

  # the original example from #1183
  a is
    o => a.this
  say (type_of a.o)

  # modification using a child of a
  b : a is
  say (type_of b.o)

  # using our own type_of implementation:
  say (my_type_of a.o)
  say (my_type_of b.o)

  # next level: doing the same thing via a type parameter
  q(T type : a, v T) =>
    say (type_of    v.o)
    say (my_type_of v.o)

  q a a
  q b b

  # next level: using this.type as a type parameter to list:
  a1 is

    # using explicit result type
    l1 list a1.this.type is [a1.this].as_list

    # using inferred result type
    l2 => [a1.this].as_list

  # and a child of that
  b1 : a1 is

  say (type_of    a1.l1)    # should print `list issue1183.a1`
  say (type_of    b1.l1)    # should print `list issue1183.b1`
  say (my_type_of a1.l1)    # should print `list issue1183.a1`
  say (my_type_of b1.l1)    # should print `list issue1183.b1`

  say (type_of    a1.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.a1`
  say (type_of    b1.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.b1`
  say (my_type_of a1.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.a1`
  say (my_type_of b1.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.b1`

  # next level: using this.type as a type parameter to list:

  a2 is
    # using inferred result type
    l2 => [a2.this].as_list

  # and a child of that
  b2 : a2 is

  say (type_of    a2.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.a2`
  say (type_of    b2.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.b2`
  say (my_type_of a2.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.a2`
  say (my_type_of b2.l2)    # should print `list issue1183.b2`
