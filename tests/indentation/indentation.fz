# indentation tests the Fuzion parser's handling of indentation in different
# contexts.
#
indentation is

  # standard indentation
  #
  feature1 is
    say "1a"
    say "1b"
    say "1c"

  # first line of code starts without LF
  #
  feature2 is say "2a"
              say "2b"
              say "2c"

  # first line of code starts without LF and contains several stmnts
  #
  feature3 is say "3a"; say "3b"
              say "3c"

  _ := feature1
  _ := feature2
  _ := feature3

  # helper feature used as target for testing indentation of actual args
  #
  called(a,b,c,d i32) =>
    say "called $a $b $c $d"

  # helper feature used a actual arg
  #
  arg => 42
