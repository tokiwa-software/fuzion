  public f1(x) =>        # 1. should flag an error: 2x feature/argument must have explicit type
------------^
For the formal argument 'reg_issue5106.f1.x' the type can only be derived if there is a call to 'reg_issue5106.f1'.


--CURDIR--/reg_issue5106.fz:29:6: error 2: Incompatible types when passing argument in a call
  f2 42                  # 3. should flag an error: Incompatible types when passing argument in a call
-----^^
Actual type for argument #1 'x' does not match expected type.
In call to          : 'reg_issue5106.f2'
expected formal type: 'String'
actual type found   : 'i32'
assignable to       : 'i32'
for value assigned  : '42'
To solve this, you could change the type of the target 'x' to 'i32' or convert the type of the assigned value to 'String'.
