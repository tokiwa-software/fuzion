# destructuring that declares a new field that masks a field used on the rhs does not work
# ===
#
#
# This small example should print '103' and '144':
# ```
#  > cat testDestructure.fz
# testDestructure is
#   a := 3
#   b := 44
#   x(v i32) => 100+v
#   (a,b) := ((x a),(x b))
#   say "a is $a"  # should print '103'
#   say "b is $b"  # should print '144'
# ```
# but its output shows that an uninitialized value was used:
# ```
#  > ./build/bin/fz testDestructure
# a is -555555455
# b is -555555455
# ```
# the output when compiled is wrong as well, but in a different way:
# ```
#  > ./build/bin/fz -c testDestructure
#  > ./testDestructure
# a is 0
# b is 0
# ```
