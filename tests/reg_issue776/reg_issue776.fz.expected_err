--CURDIR--/reg_issue776.fz:28:5: error 1: Call has an ambiguous result type since target of the call is a 'ref' type.
    ref : String
----^
The result type of this call depends on the target type.  Since the target type is a 'ref' type that may represent a number of different actual dynamic types, the result type is not clearly defined.
Called feature: 'String.mysubstring.anonymous'
Raw result type: '(value String.this).mysubstring.anonymous'
Type depending on target: 'value String.this'
Target type: '(value String.this).mysubstring.this.anonymous'
To solve this, you could try to use a value type as the target type of the call, e,g., '(value String.this).mysubstring', or change the result type of 'String.mysubstring.anonymous' to no longer depend on 'value String.this'.

one error.
