# Regression test for #536: https://github.com/tokiwa-software/fuzion/issues/536
#
issue536 is

  # missing else branch, indirect assignment
  # of unit to choice `outcome unit`
  log_indirect(a bool) outcome unit is
    if !a
        error "a is false"

  say (log_indirect (envir.args.count < 2))
  say (log_indirect (envir.args.count > 2))


  # missing else branch, direct assignment
  # of unit to result of log_direct
  log_direct(a bool) unit is
    if !a
        unit

  say (log_direct (envir.args.count < 2))
  say (log_direct (envir.args.count > 2))
