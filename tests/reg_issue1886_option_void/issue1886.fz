# this uses type parameters to create `option void` and uses this
#
test_option_void is

  # another stream like nile, but of type `option nil`
  #
  rhein(T type) option T is nil

  # match on a type parametric option
  f(T type, x option T) =>
    match x
      nil => say "got nil, not $T"
      T   => say "got $T"

  # this should show `got nil`
  f void (rhein void)

  # this should not call `f` at all, but the compiler should work
  f void (panic "test")
