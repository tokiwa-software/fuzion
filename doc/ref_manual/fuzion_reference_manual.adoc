== About this Document

=== Audience

CAUTION: *NYI*: Audience spec missing!

=== Conventions

This is work in progress. Areas where information is known to be preliminary,
missing or wrong might be marked as follows:

CAUTION: *NYI*: This spec is work in progress!

Generally, *NYI* is used in this document, as well as through any other files
related to the Fuzion project, to mark sections that need further work or future
enhancements.  This is often equivalent to comments starting *TODO* or similar
used in other projects.

The specification contains a number of rules that must be implemented by the
language implementations. These rules are identified by identifiers such as
*DOMAIN_DETAIL*. Rules are shown as follows:

:RULE_SRC: doc/ref_manual/demo_rule.txt
:RULE_ID: DOMAIN_DETAIL
include::rule.adoc[]


== Input

=== Input Sources

Fuzion source code input may come from different sources including source code
files, streams such as the standard input stream of a Unix shell command,
interactive input in an interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop (indexterm2:[REPL]), command line arguments, etc.

For source code files, the following rule applies:

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/fe/SourceModule.java
:RULE_ID: SRCF_DOTFZ
include::rule.adoc[]

=== Directories

Source files may be organized in a hierarchy of directories.  Source files in
sub-directories are automatically considered as input only if corresponding
outer features exist:

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/fe/SourceModule.java
:RULE_ID: SRCF_DIR
include::rule.adoc[]


=== Input encoding

Fuzion input sources use UTF8 encoding.

include::{GENERATED}/doc/unicode_version.adoc[]

CAUTION: NYI: Actual Unicode version has not been fixed yet!

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/util/SourceFile.java
:RULE_ID: SRCF_UTF8
include::rule.adoc[]



== Syntax

=== Lexical Tokens

The Unicode code points of the input data are grouped into lexical tokens.  The
main groups of tokens are white space, reserved keywords, identifiers, literals
and comments.  The following sub-sections describe these in detail.

==== Unsupported Code Points

[#unsupported_code_points]
Certain code points are not supported and will not be converted into tokens by
the lexer but instead result in an error when processing input data containing
these code points. The following code points are ((unsupported code points)).

// [none] means no bullet points
[none]
include::{GENERATED}/doc/codepoints_illegal.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_LEGALCP
include::rule.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_UNUSEDCP
include::rule.adoc[]

==== White Space

[#whitespace_code_points]
White space are code points that are ignored when creating tokens. Nevertheless,
white space often plays an important role in separating tokens such as a
keyword from an identifier as in `if&nbsp;condition`.

The following code points in the input are considered ((white space)).

// [none] means no bullet points
[none]
include::{GENERATED}/doc/codepoints_white_space.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_WHITESPACE
include::rule.adoc[]

Even though white space does directly create tokens, the Fuzion language parser
is affected by the presence of white space, e.g., to group blocks of code by a
common level of indentation or to separate actual arguments provided to a call.

==== Code point categories

[#fuzion_letter]
The following code points are considered Fuzion letters:

// [none] means no bullet points
[none]
include::{GENERATED}/doc/codepoints_letter.adoc[]

[#fuzion_digit]
The following code points are considered Fuzion digits:

// [none] means no bullet points
[none]
include::{GENERATED}/doc/codepoints_digit.adoc[]

[#fuzion_numeric]
The following code points are considered Fuzion numerics:

// [none] means no bullet points
[none]
include::{GENERATED}/doc/codepoints_numeric.adoc[]

[#fuzion_op]
The following code points are considered Fuzion operator code points:

// [none] means no bullet points
[none]
include::{GENERATED}/doc/codepoints_op.adoc[]

==== Lines and Columns

Each code point in an xref:input_source[Input sources] has an associated line
and column. The first code point is in line `1` column `1`. Each code point that
is not following a end of line marker is part of the same line as the previous
code point and the line of the previous code point incremented by `1`.

A code point that follows an end of line marker gets its line number increased
by `1` and its column reset to `1`.

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/util/SourceFile.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_NEWLINE
include::rule.adoc[]

NOTE: In Fuzion, the lines and columns are not only relevant when referring to code
location, e.g., when reporting error in the source code, but also have an effect
on how code is parsed: In certain contexts such as in a one-line comment or at a
given indentation level, the position of code affects the way the code is
parsed.

==== Keywords

[#fuzion_keyword]
The Fuzion grammar knows the following reserved keyword:

====
include::{GENERATED}/doc/keywords.adoc[]
====

==== Identifiers

[#fuzion_identifier]
Identifiers in Fuzion are used to attach names to xref:fuzion_feature[Fuzion
features].  Identifiers may contain a large variety of letters, digits and
numeric symbols, they must start with a letter.

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_IDENT1
include::rule.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_IDENT2
include::rule.adoc[]

==== Operators

[#fuzion_operator]
Similar to an xref:fuzion_identifier[identifier], a Fuzion operator may be part of
a name of a xref:fuzion_feature[Fuzion features].  Such features permit a call syntax
that uses infix, prefix or postfix notation.

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_OPER1
include::rule.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_OPER2
include::rule.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_OPER3
include::rule.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_OPER4
include::rule.adoc[]

Examples for legal operators are `+`, `%%%`, `??`, `∀`, `∙`, `---` `>`, `/-/`, `*//`, `*#`.

Examples for non-operators are `?`, `//`, `#*`.

==== Comments

Fuzion offers three kinds of comments: single line comments that start with
either `#` or `//` and that extend to the end of the source code line, and
nestable comments using `/\*` and `\*/` that may extends over several lines of
code.

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_COMMENT1
include::rule.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_COMMENT2
include::rule.adoc[]

:RULE_SRC: src/dev/flang/parser/Lexer.java
:RULE_ID: LEXR_COMMENT3
include::rule.adoc[]

Examples of valid comments areas

    i := 42     # this is a comment
    this is not a comment
    j := 32168  // this is also a comment
    k := /* this is a comment */ 23
    /* this /* comment /* is */ nested */ */
    l := "not a comment, but a string literal"
    /* this
    /* comment
    /* extends */
       over several
    */ lines */
    m := l

[appendix]
== Glossary

[#fuzion_abstract]
((Abstract Feature)):: An _abstract feature_ is a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] declared using `=> abstract`.

[#fuzion_actual]
((Actual)):: An _actual argument_ is an expression that is parsed as an `actual` as part of a
xref:feature_call[call] or the right hand side of an infix operator call.

[#fuzion_actual_typeparameter]
((Actual Type Parameter)):: An _actual type parameter_ is a xref:fuzion_type[type] that replaces a
xref:fuzion_typeparameter[type parameter] of the feature a type is based on.

[#fuzion_argument]
((Argument)):: An _argument_ is a xref:fuzion_typeparameter[type parameter] or a xref:fuzion_field[field]
that is declared in the `formArgs` section of a xref:fuzion_routine[routine].

[#child_feature]
((Child)):: A _child_ of a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `f` is any feature `g` that xref:inheritance[inherits] from `f`.
A _child_ is hence used synonymously to an _heir_.

[#fuzion_choice]
((Choice)):: A _choice_ is either the xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `choice` defined in the Fuzion base library or
any feature that is a xref:direct_child(direct child) of the base library feature `choice`.  A choice's arguments
must all be xref:fuzion_typeparameter[type parameters] and a choice may not contain code.

[#choice_type]
((Choice Type)):: A _choice type_ is a xref:fuzion_type[type] that is based
on a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] that is a xref:fuzion_choice[choice].

[#fuzion_constructor]
((Constructor)):: A _constructor_ is a xref:fuzion_routine[routine] declared using `is`.  A
constructor has exceutable code and defines a xref:fuzion_type[type].  On a call to a constructor,
an instance of this type is created and this instance is implicitly returned as a result after
execution of the constructor's code.

// ((Clazz)):: CAUTION: *NYI*: Text Missing  -- maybe not needed in the ref manual, this is an IR / backend concept --

[#call_destination]
((Call Destination)):: The _destination_ of a call `t.f a b` is the feature `f'` that was selected at runtime
by xref:dynamic_dispatch[dynamic dispatch] depending on the call target `t` and the xref:feature_name[feature name]
given in the call.

[#direct_child]
((Direct Child)):: A _direct child_ of a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `p` is any feature `c` that xref:direct_inheritance[inherits directly] from `p`.

[#direct_inheritance]
((Direct Inheritance)):: A xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `f` _inherits directly_ from another xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `g` if `f` lists
`g` in the inherits clause of its declaration.

[#direct_parent]
((Direct Parent)):: A _direct parent_ of a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `c` is any feature `p` such that `c` xref:direct_inheritance[inherits directly] from `p`.

[#dynamic_type]
((Dynamic Type)):: The _dynamic type_ of an expression is the xref:runtime_type[runtime type] of an
xref:fuzion_instance[instance] produced as the result of that expression.

[#dynamic_dispatch]
((Dynamic Dispatch)):: _Dynamic dispatch_ is a mechanism that is used at runtime to determine the
xref:call_destination[destination] of a xref:fuzion_call[call] depending on the
xref:dynamic_type[dynamic type] of the xref:fuzion_target[target] and xref:feature_name[name] of the
called feature.

[#fuzion_feature]
((Feature)):: A _feature_ is the most fundamental entity of Fuzion.  A feature can
be declared and can be called.  Features generalize fairly different concepts
found in other programming languages such as functions, methods, constructors,
classes, structs, records, packages, interfaces, fields, and local variables.
A Fuzion feature may be one of the following variants: a xref:fuzion_constructor[constructor],
a xref:fuzion_function[function], a xref:fuzion_field[field], a xref:fuzion_choice[choice],
a xref:fuzion_typeparameter[type parameter], an xref:fuzion_abstract[abstract feature],
an xref:fuzion_intrinsic[intrinsic], a xref:fuzion_native[native feature],
or the xref:universe[universe].  Every feature except the xref:universe[universe] is declared within
an xref:outer_feature[outer feature].

[#fuzion_call]
((Feature Call)):: A _feature call_ is an expression in Fuzion code that calls a
xref:call_destination[destination] xref:fuzion_feature[feature] on a given xref:fuzion_target[target] giving zero
or more xref:fuzion_actual[actual arguments].  An example is `t.f a b` that calls
a feature with xref:feature_name[name] `f,2` on target `t` giving two xref:fuzion_actual[actual arguments] `a` and `b`.

[#feature_name]
((Feature Name)):: A _feature name_ is the combination of an identifier and an integer xref:fuzion_argument[argument] count.

[#fuzion_field]
((Field)):: A _field_ is a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] that is either declared using `:=` or an xref:fuzion_argument[argument].  A
field can hold an xref:fuzion_instance[instance] that is assigned to it at runtime when executing its declaration as an expression (for fields declared using `:=`) or when an
xref:fuzion_actual[actual argument] is passed to a call. A field can be the xref:call_destination[destination] of a xref:feature_call[call], execution
of that call at runtime results in the xref:fuzion_instance[instance] that was assigned to that field.

[#fuzion_function]
((Function)):: A _function_ is a xref:fuzion_routine[routine] declared using `=>`. A
function has exceutable code that produces a result value `result` and an explicit or inferred result type `rt`.

[#function_type]
((Function Type)):: A _function type_ is any type derived from the Fuzion base
library feature `Function` by giving actual arguments or a type that is derived
from a Fuzion feature that inherits from a function type.

[#inheritance]
((Inheritance)):: An xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `f` is said to _inherit_ from a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `g` if
`f` equals `g` or, recursively, `f` xref:direct_inheritance[inherits directly] from a feature `h` that inherits from `g`.

[#input_source]
((Input Source)):: An _input source_ is a stream of bytes that contains Fuzion
code that is used as an input for tools like Fuzion compilers.

[#fuzion_instance]
((Instance)):: An _instance_ is a value of a given xref:runtime_type[runtime type]. Instances exist only at runtime. Instances are created
either by a xref:fuzion_call[call] or by xref:fuzion_tagging[tagging].

[#fuzion_intrinsic]
((Intrinsic Feature)):: An _intrinsic feature_ is a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] declared using `=> intrinsic` or `=> intrinsic_constructor`.

[#fuzion_native]
((Native Feature)):: A _native feature_ is a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] declared using `=> native`.
CAUTION: *NYI*: Need more detail on native feature

[#outer_instance]
((Outer Instance)):: With the exception of the xref:universe_instance[universe instance], every instance is linked to a corresponding _outer instance_.
For the instance of a xref:fuzion_routine[routine], the outer instance is the value of the xref:fuzion_target[target] of the call that created the
instance. The outer instance of xref:choice_instance[choice instance] is the xref:universe_instance[universe instance].

[#outer_feature]
((Outer Feature)):: The _outer feature_ `o` of a feature `f` is the xref:fuzion_feature[feature] that contains the
declaration of `f`.  If `f` is not declared inside any other feature, `f`'s outer feature is the
xref:universe[universe], which itself does not have an outer feature.

[#fuzion_outer_type]
((Outer Type)):: For any xref:fuzion_type[type] that is based on a feature whose outer feature `o` exists and is not the xref:universe[universe],
there is a corresponding _outer type_ based on a xref:child_feature[child] of `o`.

[#parent_feature]
((Parent)):: A _parent_ of a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `f` is any feature `g` such that `f` xref:inheritance[inherits] from `g`.
A _parent_ is hence used synonymously to an _ancestor_.

[#fuzion_routine]
((Routine)):: A _routine_ is a xref:fuzion_feature[Feature] declared using `is` or `=>` that is neither
an xref:fuzion_abstract[abstract feature], a xref:fuzion_choice[choice], an xref:fuzion_intrinsic[intrinsic feature] nor a
xref:fuzion_native[native feature].

[#real_child]
((Real Child)):: A _real child_ of a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `p` is any feature `c` that xref:real_inheritance[inherits really] from `p`.

[#real_inheritance]
((Real Inheritance)):: An xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `f` is said to _inherit really_ from a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `g` if
`f` does not equal `g` and `f` xref:inheritance[inherits] from `g`.

[#real_parent]
((Real Parent)):: A _real parent_ of a xref:fuzion_feature[feature] `c` is any feature `p` such that `c` xref:real_inheritance[inherits really] from `p`.

[#result_type]
((Result Type)):: A _result type_ is xref:static_type[static type] defined for a feature that may be xref:fuzion_call[called].

[#runtime_type]
((Runtime Type)):: A _runtime type_ is a xref:fuzion_type[type] that does not contain any xref:fuzion_typeparameter[type parameters].

[#static_type]
((Static Type)):: The _static type_ is the xref:fuzion_type[type] of an expression or the xref:result_type[result type] of a routine or a
field determined statically by tools like a Fuzion compiler.

[#fuzion_tagging]
((Tagging)):: _Tagging_ is the creation of an xref:fuzion_instance[instance] of a xref:choice_type[choice type] during an assignment
of an instance to a xref:fuzion_field[field].

[#fuzion_target]
((Target)):: The _target_ is part of a xref:fuzion_call[feature call]. The xref:dynamic_type[dynamic type] of the target
together with the xref:feature_name[feature name] of the call determines the xref:call_destination[destination] of the call.

[#fuzion_type]
((Type)):: A _type_ is either a reference to a xref:fuzion_typeparameter[type parameter] or based on a
xref:fuzion_feature[feature] of type xref:fuzion_constructor[constructor] or
xref:fuzion_choice[choice].  If that feature has xref:fuzion_typeparameter[type parameters], a type has
corresponding xref:fuzion_actual_typeparameters[actual type parameters].  If the base has an xref:outer_feature[outer feature] that is
not the xref:universe[universe], the type has an xref:fuzion_outer_type[outer type].

[#fuzion_typeparameter]
((Type Parameter)):: A _type parameter_ is an xref:fuzion_argument[argument] that can hold a xref:runtime_type[runtime type value].

[#unit_type]
((Unit type)):: A _unit type_ is a type that contains no direct xref:fuzion_field[inner fields] defined by a xref:fuzion_constructor[constructor]
whose xref:outer_feature[outer feature] is either the xref:universe[universe]  or itself a xref:fuzion_constructor[constructor]
defining a unit type.

[#universe]
((Universe)):: The _universe_ is an implicitly declared feature that
is the xref:outer_feature[outer feature] of all xref:fuzion_feature[features] that are not explicitly declared within another feature.

[#universe_instance]
((Universe Instance)):: The _universe instance_ is an implicit singleton instance created by the implicit call to the xref:universe[universe] on system
startup.
