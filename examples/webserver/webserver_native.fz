# webserver is a minimalistic webserver example using the networking
# facilities provided by Fuzion itself.
#
# To start this webserver, use:
#
#   fz webserver_native.fz
#
# Alternatively, compile it using the C backend and run the resulting
# executable:
#
#   fz -c webserver_native.fz
#   ./webserver
#
webserver_native is

  # just to install the default mutate effect
